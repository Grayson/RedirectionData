# RedirectionData

This is a small repo to test some ideas using Swift packages.  [Redirection](https://github.com/Grayson/Redirection) is being refactored to move the URL redirecting logic into a background application.  This project is a bit of an effort to get used to using Swift packages and experiment with Swift packages as a means for application modularization.
